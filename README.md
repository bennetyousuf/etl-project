# ETL-Project - Team 4
This repository is the main repository for team 4 and our ETL project

## Project Proposal

Imagine a bunch of data came in and you and your team are tasked with migrating it to a production data base.

## Finding Data

Our team decided to look into the player and salary data regarding the team with the most historical wins from 1947 through 2018

**The below data set are being used for this project:**

- [NBA - Player Salary (1990-2018)](https://www.kaggle.com/whitefero/nba-player-salary-19902017 "NBA - Player Salary (1990-2018)")

- [Winningest Cities in Sports](https://data.world/the-pudding/winningest-cities-in-sports "Winningest Cities in Sports")

## Data Cleanup & Analysis

Perform ETL on the data

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository details the following steps:

- The sources of data that you will extract from.
- The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
- The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
- The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

## Project Report

The Jupyter notebook within this repository describes the following:

- **Extract:** your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
- **Transform:** what data cleaning or transformation was required.
- **Load:** the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
